### 3. Install Dependencies

### 4. Add a .env File

To run the app, create a `.env` file in the root folder with the following properties (I have included a few demo values hereÂ for testing):

```
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=5000
DB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/bike-rental

JWT_RESET_SECRET=demo_secret
JWT_ACCESS_EXP_IN=7d
JWT_REFRESH_EXP_IN=365d
JWT_RESET_EXP_IN=10M

CLOUDINARY_NAME=your_cloudinary_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
